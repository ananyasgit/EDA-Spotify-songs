The dataset is borrowed from Kaggle which can be found by following the link -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset. This notebook demonstrates how differently the EDA for any NLP task is approched. It is different from the EDA done on structured data. The datasets used contain unstructured textual data which have to be dealt with differently.
